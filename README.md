# SmartHome

The cross-platform application that can be used as control unit for smart home infrastructure.

Main idea is to provide the solution that can be used on any platform supported by Qt to deploy infrastructure for smart home eco system.
It's supposed to be integrated into door(s), window(s) or any other proper place in the building.

The system has been tested so far on Ubuntu 18.04 and Android 7.0 with Qt 5.12.3.
